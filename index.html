    <h1>Nick Presta</h1>
    <p>Hey! I'm Nick, a software developer in Toronto, Canada.</p>
    <p>
      I'm passionate about solving real problems for people through technology.
      I currently work in the FinTech space, at
      <a href="https://waveapps.com" title="Wave - A Toronto startup that builds tools for small businesses">Wave</a>,
      where I am the tech lead on our Invoicing product to help small business owners get paid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of my responsibilities include hiring, mentoring, architecting systems,
      and working with other teams to build infrastructure that is used company wide.
    </p>
    <p>
      Right now, I'm really excited about React and the related JavaScripte ecosystem (ES2015+, Redux, ImmutableJS, etc). I also like writing Python, and Go, and I'm playing around with Elm and Rust.
    </p>
